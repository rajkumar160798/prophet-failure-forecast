# Prophet Failure Forecast ‚Äì Predictive Maintenance with Time Series

This project uses [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to forecast temperature sensor data and predict when equipment is likely to **fail in the future**.

It builds upon my earlier project on anomaly detection by taking a **proactive, forecast-driven approach** to smart automation.

Based on my technical blog:

## üöÄ Objective

To simulate sensor temperature data and apply **time-series forecasting** to predict when temperature values will cross a critical failure threshold (78¬∞F) ‚Äî enabling early intervention in predictive maintenance systems.
